    <p>1.1 Propositional Languages
        With the term sentence we mean any proposition for which it is it makes sense to ask
        whether it is true or false. For example, propositions such as ‘’Paul is running”, “Laura has
        red hair”, “It rains and it is a windy day”, “If it’s sunny, then I go to the sea” are sentences.
        On the contrary, propositions such as “It’s sunny, isn’t it?”, “Paul, come home soon!”, whose
        content does not consist in a mere statement, are not considered to be sentences.
        Informally, we then say that a sentence is a simple sentence or an atomic sentence
        if it contains no other sentence as its proper part. Let’s say instead that a sentence is a
        composite sentence if it contains other sentences, that is, if it is possible to break it
        down into simpler sentences. For example, the propositions “Paul runs” and “Laura has
        red hair“ are atomic sentences; on the other hand, examples of composite sentences are
        “It rains and it is a windy day”, “If it is sunny I go to the sea” and “Carla has black eyes
        or Carla has black hair” (to see that “It’s raining and it is a windy day” is a composed
        sentence, it is sufficient to observe that “It is raining and it is a windy day” contains as its
        proper parts the two sentences “It is raining” and “It is a windy day”.)
        The words “and”, “or”, “if ... then”, “not”, “but” are called connectives. Connectives
        allow therefore to obtain sentences from other sentences, that is, they allow to obtain
        composed sentences from simple sentences. Let’s consider the composed sentence “It rains
        and it is a windy day”. If we associate with the atomic sentence “it rains” the letter p, with
        the atomic statement “it is a windy day” the letter q and we indicate with the character ∧
        the connective “and”, we can associate with the sentence “It rains and it is a windy day”

        a formal expression of the type p ∧ q. The expression p ∧ q is an example of a formula;
        in general formulas will be particular expressions obtained from a given set of symbols,
        called propositional letters, through an appropriate application of connectives. Formulas
        constitute a (rough and simplified) representation in an artificial language of the conceptual
        content of natural language sentences. Let us now define the concept of formula in a precise
        manner.
        A propositional language L is just a set, whose elements are called propositional
        
        letters; they are indicated with the characters p, q, r, . . . (possibly with sub- and super-
        scripts). Since we are interested in computational applications, we assume that L is finite
        
        or countable (in the latter case the elements of L can be put in bijective correspondence
        with natural numbers).
        Using the elements of L, the brackets (,) and the special characters relative to the
        propositional connectives ∧ ("and"), ∨ ("or"), → ("if...then"), ¬ ("not"), we are in
        principle able to write down all symbol strings like for instance
        (∗) p ∨ ¬qqq, ¬¬)p∧, (¬(p ∨ q)), . . .
        Not all such symbol strings are acceptable from the point of view of our formal grammar,
        that is not all symbol strings are to be considered L-formulas. We call L-formulas or
        formulas only the symbol strings that are obtained by applying finitely many times the
        following formation rules:
        (i) every p ∈ L is a formula (this is said to be an atomic formula);
        (ii) if A1 and A2 are formulas, so are (A1 ∧ A2), (A1 ∨ A2), (A1 → A2), (¬A1).
        We can equivalently rephrase the above formation rules as follows: a symbol string is a
        L-formula iff (from now on, ‘iff ’ abbreviates ‘if and only if ’) it happens to occur as a
        last entry in a L-construction, where a L-costruction is a list of symbol strings, each entry
        of which is either a string formed by a single character belonging to L or it is obtained
        from previous entries according to the rules (ii) above. For instance, the L-costruction
        
        p, q, (p ∨ q), (¬(p ∨ q))
        
        witnesses that (¬(p ∨ q)) is a formula. On the contrary, the first and the second symbol
        strings mentioned in (∗) are not formulas because there does not exist a L-costruction
        ending into them (try to build it and you will see that it is not possible!).
        
        Propositional Languages and Truth Tables 3
        Formulas are denoted by the letters A, B, . . . (called metavariables), possibly endowed
        with sub- and super-scripts. The set of all formulas is denoted with FL.
        We need some notational conventions.
        • The introduction of brackets (inside the definition of a formula) is needed in order to
        guarantee the uniqueness of reading, i.e. to be able to reconstruct in a unique way
        the construction procedure of a formula. We won’t formally prove the uniqueness of
        reading theorem (to avoid a too detailed boring exposition), however we mention
        that reading uniqueness is needed to avoid amibiguities in many circumstances.
        In particular, reading uniqueness allow to identify, for a non atomic formula, the
        main connective of the formula, which is the last connective introduced during the
        construction of the formula. For instance, the main connective of ((p ∧ q) → (q ∨ p))
        is →.
        • However, the use of brackets will be subject to some liberalization, for instance the
        external brackets will be systematically omitted. To alleviate reading, we stipulate
        the following binding precedences: ¬ binds strongerly than ∧, ∨, and the latter bind
        strongerly than →. As a consequence, for instance, ¬p → q ∨ r stands for ((¬p) →
        (q ∨ r)). On the other hand, the writing p ∧ q ∨ r is considered to be ambiguous and
        brackets are needed to distinguish (p ∧ q) ∨ r from p ∧ (q ∨ r).
        • Abbreviations like p ∧ q ∧ r might be used, conventionally p1 ∧ · · · ∧ pn stands for
        (p1 ∧ (p2 ∧ (· · ·(pn−1 ∧ pn)· · ·))). The same convention applies to ∨, but no similar
        convention holds for → (as a consequence, writing p → q → r won’t be allowed).
        • A ↔ B stands for (A → B) ∧ (B → A): the defined connective ↔ is called
        ‘bi-implication’ or ‘material equivalence’. One could restrict the list of primitive
        connectives, our choice for the set {∧, ∨,→, ¬} is not minimal in this sense.
        • The notation A(p1, . . . , pn) means that the propositional letters that have been used
        in the construction of A are included in the list p1, . . . , pn (when we use this notation,
        we assume that such list does not contain repetitions).
        • It will be useful for proofs and formal definitions to have at hand a complexity measure
        c for our formulas; we could simply count the number of symbols to get a complexity
        measure, however usually it is sufficient to count the number of the connectives. In
        
        Propositional Languages and Truth Tables 4
        order to formally introduce the function c counting the number of the connectives
        of a formula, we can formally say that c(p) = 0 for p ∈ L, c(¬A) = c(A) + 1,
        c(A1 ∗A2) = c(A1) +c(A2) + 1 for ∗ = ∧, ∨, →. A definition like this one is said to be
        an inductive definition and is characterized by the fact that it works in a progressive
        way from simple to composite formulae. In other words, in order to introduce the
        function c, we stipulated that atomic formulas have zero connectives and that a
        formula like A∨B has a number of connectives equal to the number of connectives of
        A plus the number of connectives of B plus one. This use is justified by the fact that
        when we evaluate c(A ∨ B), we already know how to evaluate c(A) and c(B) (this is
        because A and B, as symbol strings, are shorter and as a consequence we can suppose
        the computation of c(A) and c(B) to have already been done). The above definition
        procedure based on reading uniqueness for formulas will be repeatedly used in the
        sequel.
        • Sub(A) indicates the set of the subformulas of the formula A; formally, we can define
        inductively this set as follows:
        - Sub(p) = {p}, for p ∈ L;
        - Sub(A ∗ B) = {A ∗ B} ∪ Sub(A) ∪ Sub(B), for ∗ = ∧, ∨,→;
        - Sub(¬A) = {¬A} ∪ Sub(A).
        
        Example 1. let A be the formula ¬p → (¬q ∨ r). The we have that c(A) = 4 and
        Sub(A) = {¬p → (¬q ∨ r), ¬q ∨ r, ¬p, ¬q, p, q, r}.
        
        1.2 Truth Functions
        A first naif way to enter into the typical logical problems consists in considering the problem
        of the correctness of inference schemata. For instance, let us consider the two inferences
        
        Inference I
        
        If it rains, I take un umbrella.
        I do not take an umbrella.
        Hence it does not rain.
        
        Propositional Languages and Truth Tables 5
        
        Inference II
        
        If it rains, I take an umbrella.
        It does not rain.
        Hence I do not take an umbrella.
        
        We want to study the correctness of these inferences. To do it, let us associate with the
        sentence “It rains” the propositional letter p, and with the sentence “I take an umbrella”
        the propositional letter q, so that Inference I can be represented as
        
        p → q
        ¬q
        ¬p
        and Inference II can be represented as
        
        p → q
        ¬p
        ¬q
        
        An inference is correct iff whenever its premises are true, so it is its conclusion. To continue
        our analysis, we need to better understand the notion of truth.
        A formula denotes an assertion that, in a given situation, turns out to be true or false
        (but not simultaneously true and false). In fact, once the truth-values of the components
        of a sentence are known, one can mechanically determine the truth value of the whole
        formula: this is because our connectives will be analyzed from a truth-functional point
        of view, that is they are considered as functions having both as input and as outputs some
        truth values. To identify the meaning of a connective just mean to specify under which
        conditions a stetement having that connective as the main connective is true or false.
        
        The semantics we are introducing is two-valued, meaning that we have just two truth-
        values (true and false): we shall indicate them as T, F or as 1, 0. We now analyze in detail
        
        the meaning of each connective.
        • The sentence “It rains and it is a windy day” is true iff both the sentences “It rains”
        and “It is a windy day” are true. Recall that the connective “and” is called conjunction
        and is denoted by the symbol ∧. Thus, if we indicate with p the sentence “It rains” and
        with q the sentence “It is a windy day”, we can formalize the sentence “It rains and it is a
        
        Propositional Languages and Truth Tables 6
        windy day” with the formula p ∧ q. According to the above observations, the formula p ∧ q
        is true iff both p and q are true.
        In general, if we consider any two sentences A and B, the formula A ∧ B is true iff
        both A and B are. We can summarize what we said via the following table, called the
        truth-table of the connective ∧:
        
        A B A ∧ B
        T T T
        F T F
        T F F
        F F F
        
        • The sentence “Carla has black eyes or Carla has black hair” on the contrary is true iff
        at least one of the sentences “Carla has black eyes” and “Carla has black hair” is true. Recall
        that the connective “or” is called disjunction and is denoted by the symbol ∨. In our
        natural language, there exists two different uses of the disjunction, namely the inclusive
        use (corresponding to the latin word ‘vel’) and the exclusive use (corresponding to the
        latin word ‘aut’). The difference between the two lies in the different evaluation of the case
        in which both disjuncts are true: in the inclusive use, the disjunction evaluates to true,
        whereas in the exclusive use it evaluates to false. We choose the inclusive interpretation,
        however we notice that this choice does not affect the expressivity of the language, because
        the exclusive disjunction can be obtained via the combination (A ∨ B) ∧ ¬(A ∧ B)).
        In general, if we consider any two sentences A and B, the formula A ∨ B is true iff
        either A or B or both are true. We can summarize what we said via the following table,
        called the truth-table of the connective ∨:
        A B A ∨ B
        T T T
        F T T
        T F T
        F F F
        
        • The sentence “It does not rain” is true iff the sentences “It rains” is false. Recall that
        the connective “not” is called negation and is denoted by the symbol ¬.
        
        Propositional Languages and Truth Tables 7
        In general, if we consider any sentence A, the formula ¬A is true iff the formula A is
        false. Thus the truth-table of the connective ¬ is:
        A ¬A
        T F
        F T
        
        The above interpretation of the negation comes from the aristotelian tradition and
        characterizes classical logic (this is the logic we study in these notes). We just mention
        that during the history and in particular in the past century there have been different and
        interesting alternative analyses of the negation, both from a syntactic and a semantic point
        of view.
        • We finally take into consideration the connective “if ... then”. This connective is
        called implication or conditional and is denoted by the symbol →. Let us examine a
        statement like “if a is an even number, then a + 1 is an odd number”. Surely we won’t
        consider a counterexample to such statement a case where the number a is not even. On
        the other hand, all possible counterexamples are those where a number a is given and is
        such that a is even and a + 1 is not odd. Since it is not possible to exhibit such a number,
        we are inclined to evaluate the sentence “if a is an even number, then a + 1 is an odd
        number” to be true. In this way, we stipulate that if A and B are any sentences, the
        formula A → B is false only when A is true and B is false. We can summarize this via the
        following truth-table for →:
        
        A B A → B
        T T T
        F T T
        T F F
        F F T
        
        Surely, such use of the implication is justified in some mathematical context, like
        the above mentioned one, however this use is far from giving an exhaustive account of
        the different interpretations of the implication in the natural language, where multiple
        meanings (eg causal or counterfactual) are present. To encompass such meanings, however,
        we need more sophisticated logical tools, which are beyond the scope of the present notes,</p>
