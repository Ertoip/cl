    <p>1) describe T-propagation:

if we are in the state <V|F|*>  and we have a literal l and a clause C such that V entails -C
and -C&-l is not T-consistent (meaning that CVl (it's negation) is T-valid)
we can then pass to the state <V,l[p]|F,Cvl|*>
    
2) descirbe T-conflict and the unsat core

suppose we are in the state <V|F|*> and that my current partial assigment is of the kind l1&l2&...&lk and that it is not T-satisfiable
we can pass to the state
<V|F,C|C> where C is the is the negation of the assigment that caused the inconsistency and it is called theory lemma 
an unsat core of a T-inconsistent set S of literals is a minimal T-inconsistent  subset of S, in the above case my conflict set of clauses 
    
3)describe resolution rule

in order to apply the resolution rule we need 2 clauses containing the same propositional letter with opposite value, the first should contain p and the second -p (or viceversa)
to get the conclusion we simply need to remove p and -p and merge the result 
pVC & -PVD gives as resolution CVD which is a logical consequence of the 2 parent clauses 
indeed if V(pVC)=1 and V(-pVD)=1 then V(CVD)=1 
in fact if V(p)=1 then v(D)=1 while if v(p)=0 then v(C)=1
    
4) formulate the subsumption rule 

the subsumption rule state that if we have in the current close both c and c1 with c1 subset of c then we can eliminate c without altering refutational completness

5) explain how to use the herbrand theoreme in handling satifiability of universal formula 

let T be a set of universal sentences, fisrt of all we need to ground instantiate all the sentences of the set T (if A is a universal sentences 
A(x1/t1...xn/tn)) and get gr(T) then the theorem state that a the set T is unsatisfiable iff the set gr(T) is unsatisfiable 
note that this new set could be infinite 

6) how does idl work? (bellam ford algorithm)

the algorithm verifies the absence of negative cycle in an appropieted weighted graph
first we write all the term in the form;
x-y<=n   n belonging to Z

once we have a finite set of literals in the above form we can check satisfiability in the following way:

we draw an arrow from y to x that as as weight n, then we check for cycle ( a cycle begin and end in the same variable/node) 
we sum the value of the n and if the cycle in non-negative than the problem is satisfiable otherwise it is unsatisfiable

7) make an exemple of convex theory;
    
 EUF and LRA (linear real arithmetics) are examples of convex theories

8) make an example of non-convex theory

IDL (linear integer arithmetics) and the theory of arrays are examples of non  convex theories. 

9) herbrand theoreme 

a set of universal sentences is satisfiable iff it is satisfiable the set of its ground intances
    
10) the language after skolemisation is richere or not?
    
the skolemization procedure produce an equi-satisfiable formula in a larger language

11) formulate the explain rule 

suppose we are in the status <V|F,Dvl|lVC>  we can pass to the status <V|F,Dvl|DVC> 
whenever we have V entails ¬c and ¬l was assigned in V
after all the nagation of the litarelas from c and d were assigned 
    
12) formulate di propagate rule 
 if we are in the status (V|F,D∨l|∗) we can go to the status
(V,lp|F,D∨l|∗), if V |= ¬D and l is not defined in V .
    
13) formulate the decision rule 

if we are in the state <V|F|*> , we can pass to the state <V,l[d]|F|*>
in case the previous
rules do not apply, l is not defined in V and either l or ¯l (or both) occur somewhere in F

14)formulate the pure literal rule

it is possible to propagate a literal l occurring somewhere in F if its opposite ¬l never occurs

15)formulate the conflict rule

if we are in the se status (V|F,C|∗) we can pass to the
status (V|F,C|C), if V |= ¬C

16)formulate the failure rule

if we are in the conflict status (V | F | C) and C is the empty clause, the
algorithm terminates with an unsatisfiability outcome.
If we are in a conflict state (V | F | C) and there are no decided literals, we can
nevertheless terminate the algorithm with an unsatisfiability outcome: this is because
iterated applications of the explain rule below would nevertheless produce a conflict state
with empy clause

17)refutational compleatness theoreme 

Theorem (refutational completeness). Let C0 be a set of clauses; we have that C0 is
inconsistent iff the empty clause belongs to R(C0)
with R being the satuarted set resulting from the end of the resolution calculus 

18)refutational completeness theoreme for ground resolution 

If T is a set of statements
that are universal closures of clauses, then T is unsatisfiable (i.e. has no model) if and
only if the empty clause belongs to R(gr(T))
with R being the set of ground clauses that can be obtained by resolution from
the propositional abstractions of the clauses of T

19)

formulate the satisfiablitiy criterion for a conjunction of atoms in IDL 

the satisfiability is given by the absence of negative weighted cycle 
a cycle start and ends in the same varible i.e x-y<=0 and anx<-1 give a negative cycle 
every literal is in the form x-y<n  the weight is given by the n an the arrow goes from y to x
                                    
20) describe the satisfiability algorithm for a conjunction of literals in EUF

21)formulate the condition of a theory to be stably infinite 

we say that T-is stably infinite if every T-satisfiable constraint is satisfiable in a infinite(countable) model of T
22)explain the role of back-jumping in the statisfiability algorithm

Back-jumping is a technique that reduces the search space and increases the efficiency of backtracking algorithms for solving the satisfiability problem (SAT)1. It allows the algorithm to backtrack to a relevant decision level, rather than following a chronological order2

23)formulate a sufficent condition for the correctness and compleatness of the nelson-oppen combination algorithm

all the variable equalities as to be assigned so, for all the pair of variable i should have either x=y or ¬x=y   (not sure this is correct)

24)compare resolution and dpll w.r.t. resource consumption

resolution may require larger space cosumption

25)write down the reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity axioms for equality
  and the congruenc axiom regarding the symbol of L
 
(forall x)  ( x=x)

(forall x)(forall y) (x=y-->y=x)

(forall x y z)(x=y and y=z --> x=z)

 congruence for D        x1=y1 & x2=y2 & x3=y3 & D(x1,x2,x3) -> D(y1,y2,y3)
  congruence for f        x=y -> f(x)=f(y)
    
26)what are the function symbol of the theory of arrays

read(a,i)
write(a,i,e) 

27)explain nelson-oppen 2 hypotesis 

1) T1 and T2 signature as to be disjoint they can share only the identity predicate
2) T1 and T2 are stably infinite 

28)explain nelson-oppen combination procedure 

if we the have a satisfiability problem of a set of literals which is mixed (i.e contains different theory) 
the idea is to check the satisfiability of T1 and T2 separately (iff they respect the 2 hypotesis we have for this algorithm) now there are 2 possibilities 
if one of them or both of them are UNSAT then the problem is UNSAT
if both of them are sat then there is one more constraint that needs to be satisfied that is that all the variable equalities as to be assigned so, for all the pair of variable i should have either x=y or ¬x=y
now we have sat if there is an assignement to variables equalities for which the separated checks succedes

important to know 

what is a literal
what is a flat literal 
what is a formula 
what is a sentence 
what is a term 
what is a flat term 
bounded unbounded variables
    
;a horn clause is a clause with at most one positive literal 
;horn clause-->(¬xVy)
;not horn clause-->(xVy)
between DPLL, resolution and congruence closure the one that may require more space is 
RESOLUTION
congruence closure does not, instead; require large time consumption
